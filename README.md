The modified version of the lecture RLtrader code is in the RLtrader_Filip python notebook.

The datasets to run the script are in the "Filip" folder

To switch from training to test configuration of the model, change the value of the variable "a" from "train" to "test" and enter the name of the dataset you want to use in the 3rd chunk of the notebook in the "data_name" variable.

Any dataset can be used for training and testing. Datasets in the "Filip" folder have a train/test indicator in their name to indicate whether they were used for train or test.

Code for the DDPG model is in the DDPG_with_Final_Output.ipynb notebook.
